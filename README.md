# Silly Goose

Silly Goose is the name of the first version of my handheld gaming PCB. I created this with the intention of having my own portable tetris gaming device. I am a great fan of tetris and was disappointed that most portable devices did not have the correct tetris rules or failed to save scores when powered off (so I took matters into my own hands!).
